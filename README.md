# Not Another Wordle Clone

As the name suggests, it's a wordle clone.
Wanted try and make something with svelte.

# Developing

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

# Improvements

- [x] ~~Animating after guessing a word. Currently svelte 5 has an issue with transition delays: [#10876](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/10876)~~ Went with a better method
- [ ] Pressing enter when a key is focused should enter the letter, rather than submit a guess
