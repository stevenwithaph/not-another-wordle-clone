# Not Another Wordle Clone

As the name suggests, it's a wordle clone.
Wanted try and make something with svelte.

# Running

`npm install
npm run dev`

# Improvements

- [ ] Animating after guessing a word. Currently svelte 5 has an issue with transition delays: (#10876)[https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/10876]
- [ ] Pressing enter when a key is focused should enter the letter, rather than submit a guess
